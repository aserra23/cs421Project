Break the string into sentences. use nltk to get tags on each word and split the sentences into a word list and a tag list. Use the brown corpus to do spelling check on all words. Use the tag list to perform the other parts of grading. Make combinations of the verb-verb tags and subject-verb tags.  If there is no verb in a sentence, it missed a verb. If the verbs tag combo is on the list created for improper combinations then, it is a mistake. Also, if the pronoun, proper noun and/or noun to verb singular/plural rule do not match then, it is mistake.  Also, the number of words and verbs of the essay are considered too because the less of those, the less chance to make mistake. On the other hand, the ratio of a mistake is higher if there is less word.
